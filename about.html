    <h2>About Pat Paige</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <img src="Pat 1.JPG" alt="Pat at poolside" class="profile-photo">
        <p>Patricia Paige Ong began her freediving journey in 2021, but her first introduction to the sport happened unexpectedly while scuba diving in Gili Trawangan. While floating at the surface, she spotted a lone freediver far below, calmly trailing a turtle without any air supply. Amazed at how long he stayed down, Pat was determined to try it for herself. After taking her first course, she experienced something remarkable: her busy mind began to quiet, and a deep sense of calm overcame her.</p>

        <p>Since then, Pat has broken 12 national records and holds all the Singaporean pool freediving records. As of August 2024, she ranks among the top 10 female freedivers in Asia and is constantly pushing her limits in both pool and depth disciplines.</p>

        <p>In January 2024, Pat shifted her focus to depth freediving, earning her first national records just a few months later. Freediving has not only allowed her to explore her physical limits but also opened doors to travel, enabling her to dive in some of Asia’s most beautiful locations. Pat is passionate about sharing these places, cultures, and underwater experiences with others.</p>

        <h3>Coaching Philosophy</h3>
        <img src="Pat 2.JPG" alt="Pat at World Championships" class="championship-photo">
        <p>Pat's coaching philosophy is simple: freediving is a sensory experience. Skills need to be felt, seen, and heard to be fully understood. She’s hands-on, watches dives in person or via video, and gives immediate, personalized feedback. She believes every diver is unique and requires tailored training to unlock their full potential.</p>

        <h3>Vision for the Future</h3>
        <p>Her vision for the future is to take divers to off-the-beaten-path locations, introducing them to places and experiences they might never encounter otherwise—all while ensuring safety and meticulous planning.</p>
